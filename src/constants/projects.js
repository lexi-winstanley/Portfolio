            motivation: 'Our motivation to develop this application was that we wanted to create something that would simplify an aspect of travel. In our experience, the most stressful part of a trip is generally the days leading up to it when you’re pressed for time and trying to remember and complete all the last minute to-dos at work or home, including packing your suitcases. We’ve all made lists of items to pack for trips before and this seemed like an area that could be streamlined as we often end up packing the same items trip after trip. We wanted to be able to dynamically generate a suggested list that the user could then further customize and save for later.',
            description: 'When a user navigates to Pack It! they are presented with a landing page where they input a destination and trip duration. These inputs are captured and the location is used to call the Open Weather Map API which returns forecast results for the next 120 hours (about five days) in three hour increments and the latitude and longitude of the forecast location. We then use that latitude and longitude to call the Webcams.Travel API which returns webcams within a 250 km (approximately 155 mile) radius which can help inform the user\'s packing plans. We display up to six webcam stills on our results page which users can click to navigate to the live stream. Using jQuery we loop through the forecast results from Open Weather Map and get the highest maximum temperature and lowest minimum temperature to display for each day. The weather description used is the first that occurs. The average high temperature over the entire forecast period is used to determine whether a warm weather or cold weather packing list should be suggested. The list display is then generated from an array. Once the user gets their results they can customize their list as desired and choose to create an account in order to save their list to our Firebase database. We use Firebase user authentication to create an email/password login and then a new node is created in our root directory using the user ID. The next time the user visits Pack It! they can log in and retrieve their saved list.',

The results of these calls are looped through and acted on as needed to generate the appropriate sections of HTML and add them to the page. Arrays are used to hold the packing list items and edited as the user adds or deletes items. If the user chooses to make an account and save their list the array is saved to the Firebase database for retrieval later.',

            description: 'In this application the computer randomly chooses a word from a predefined array of dog breeds, then displays underscores corresponding to the number of letters. The user then presses keys to guess letters that may be in the word. If they guess a letter that is in the word the appropriate blanks are changed to that letter and the number of letters remaining in the word decreases. If they guess a letter that is not in the word it is displayed on the page as an incorrect letter guessed and the number of guesses remaining decreases. \nThe user is allowed 10 incorrect guesses, if they do not guess all the letters in the word before they run out of guesses the number of losses is incremented and the game resets. If they guess the word correctly then the number of wins is incremented and the game resets. \nWhen the game resets the computer randomly chooses a new word from the remaining dog breeds in the array and the incorrect guesses are cleared and number of guesses remaining set back to 10. Each time the computer selects a new word the picture is updated to display a dog of the previous breed (i.e. if the previous word was "poodle" when the computer selects a new word the picture will update to be of a poodle). The computer will go through each word in the array once before beginning to repeat words. There are 20 unique dog breeds in the game.',
